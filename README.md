# InboxPager

![screenshot](https://github.com/itprojects/InboxPager/raw/master/img/1.png)

An E-mail client for the Android (java) platform. Supports imap, pop, and smtp protocols, through SSL/TLS.

# Usage

In order to use this application you have to enable application-email-checking through your server's web interface. Some email servers may have this feature already turned on (NOT GMAIL!, see below). If your account's server does not support this feature, it won't work.

Setting up an account in InboxPager happens through "Settings" > "Add Account". There, you have to enter your account's credentials, server parameters. If you don't know what your email account's server parameters are - try the automatic tools provided, otherwise enter and test your own configuration. Optionally, if you'd like to receive a sound or vibration notification tick those settings. If you wish to only refresh a specific account, when you individually choose to, then untick the "Allow in all-accounts-refresh".

By default InboxPager DOES NOT KEEP "FULL MESSAGE" copies of emails, instead, just gets the main textual contents of the message. If you wish to change this policy you can do this in the settings for individual account. In order to save email and/or attachments, the full message must be already in the internal database, or alternatively (re-)download the full message and then extract the attachment through the application. Be advised - keeping full messages can easily consume your device's internal memory.

# Features

The app can:

- Animate a smooth transition between visual contexts.

- Automatically convert texts from their declared character encoding to UTF-8. 

- Download your full email messages (with attachments inside).

- Download an individual attachment.

- Display server certificates used in the last connection.

- Keep track of your unread messages.

- Notify with sound of new messages, per user choice.

- Notify with device vibration of new messages, per user choice.

## WON'T FIX

- Automatically, on a cloud server, Save/Restore interrnal database. If a backup of the local device is necessary, then close the app and copy/paste the database from "/data/data/...".

- Backend that runs in the background.

- Contacts integration with rest of Android OS.

- Forwarding messages (digests), from inside the app.

- Full IMAP folders. The app is more "lite", than complete all-features gmail-replacement.

- Ordinary non-SSL/TLS.

- Printing messages on papaer. You can save them to file, and print them manually.

# Permissions

InboxPager uses android permissions on the local device for the following reasons:

ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, INTERNET:

Communication with message server defined by user. Downloading/Uploading messages.

VIBRATE:

Device can be made to vibrate, if new messages have arrived. Users can disable this setting from inside the application.

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:

In order to save messages or attachments on an SDCARD.
IF users save only to internal memory, then the permission can be disabled entirely.

## Requirements

In general - a network connection that does not implement (small) download quotas.

For a POP (Post Office Protocol 3) mail server:

- Support for the extensions TOP, SASL and UIDL.

- LOTS of internal phone memory.

## Known Items

If there are any errors in the application they should be available in the Event Log.

- If while downloading a large attachment you experience errors, then close some other applications to get more RAM.

- Message and attachment sizes should always only an approximation.

- POP has no way to know if a message has been previously seen.

- Sent messages are not saved locally, most servers save those automatically.

## Bug Reporting

# GMAIL Configuration

To enable application access to your GMail inbox, go to:

https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps

Then and only then, in the application:

Username: your.username@gmail.com

Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server: imap.gmail.com

Port: 993

Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server: smtp.gmail.com

Port for SSL: 465

Sometimes checking GMAIL too ofter (<10 minutes) may or may not block application access to account.
